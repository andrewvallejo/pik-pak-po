# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Andrew Vallejo

## I am the creator of Pik-Pak-Po

Do you like PokÃ©mon games and all of their franchise? Well then prepare yourself to be mildly dissapointed! If pokÃ©mon could more simpler then we have done it here, y'all! Welcome to Pik-Pak-Po, the rock paper scissors version of pokemon! Each player gets a pokÃ©mon that have three moves that have one weakness and one offense. The moves are **SWIPE**, **HARDEN**, and **ABILITY**. The rules are your standard rock-paper-scissors. If you decide you want to progress beyond the tutorial, then you be able to choose to use a potion. Be careful now, everybody has a healthbar now.  Once you finish the tutorial, then your adventure begins..


## Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / Pokemon Master

#### Battle!
Battle with the same battle script as the pokemon video games! In the tutorial (normal version) of the game, you will be given 3 options, swipe, harden, and ability. The sequence in which the moves beat eachother are as follows: <br>
**ABILITY < SWIPE < HARDEN < ABILITY** <br>
Players will take turns choosing their moves and the player who chooses the stronger moves wins

### Future Features
The player who chooses the losing move will lose one HP
